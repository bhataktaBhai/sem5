\begin{proposition}
    Let $U$ be a convex open subset of $\R^n$.
    Let $f\colon U \to \R^m$ be differentiable and let \[
        \sup_{x \in U} \norm{f'(a)} = M.
    \] Then for any $a, b \in U$, \[
        \norm{f(a) - f(b)} \le M \norm{b - a}.
    \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $U \subseteq \R^n$ be open and connected and $f\colon U \to \R^m$
    be differentiable.
    If $f' \equiv 0$ on $U$, then $f$ is constant on $U$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Fix $a \in U$.
    Let $W = \sset{x \in U}{f(x) = f(a)}$.
    In the subset topology on $U$, $W$ is closed since $W = f^{-1}(f(a))$.
    But $W$ is open since \TODO. % TODO
    Thus $W$ is all of $U$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition} \label{thm:pdv-cont}
    Let $U \subseteq \R^n$ be open and $f\colon U \to \R^m$ be such that
    $D_j f_i$ exist and are bounded on $U$.
    Then $f$ is continuous.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Fix an $i \in [m]$.
    Let each $D_j$ be bounded by $M$ on all of $U$.
    Let $x \in U$ and $\eps > 0$ be such that
    $B_{L^\infty}(x, \eps) \subseteq U$.
    Let $(y_1, \dots, y_n) \in B_{L^\infty}(x, \eps)$.
    Consider $x^{(i)} = x + (y_i - x_i) e_i$.
    Then \[
        \norm{f_i(x^{(i+1)}) - f_i(x^{(i)})} \le M \abs{y_i}
    \] by the mean value theorem.
    By the triangle inequality, \[
        \norm{f_i(y) - f_i(x)} \le M \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{y_i - x_i}
            \le M n \eps. \qedhere
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} \label{def:c1}
    Let $U \subseteq \R^n$ be open.
    $C^1(U, \R^m)$ is the set of all functions $f\colon U \to \R^m$
    such that $f'\colon U \to L(\R^n, \R^m)$ exists and is continuous.
\end{definition}
