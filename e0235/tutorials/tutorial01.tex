\section{Shamir Sharing} \label{sec:shamir}
A polynomial of decree $t$ \[
    f(x) = s + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots + a_t x^t.
\] where $s$ is the secret.
Any $t$ pairs $(x, f(x))$ fail to determine the polynomial.
Any $t + 1$ pairs $(x, f(x))$ determine the polynomial.

Consider a new secret sharing scheme as follows:
\begin{problem}[replicative secret sharing]
    $\mcP = \set{P_1, \dots, P_n}$.
    For every subset $T \subseteq \mcP$ of size $n - t$, there is a share
    $S_T$ held by all $P_i \in T$.
    The secret is defined as $S = \sum_T S_T$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Is this scheme secure if an adversary is allowed to corrupt
        $t$ of the parties?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
