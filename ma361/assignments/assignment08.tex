% Problem 1
\begin{problem*}
    Let $X_n$ be independent random variables with $X_n \sim \Ber(p_n)$.
    For $k \ge 1$, find a sequence $(p_n)$ so that almost surely, the
    sequence $X_1, X_2, \dots$ has infinitely many segments of ones of
    length $k$ but only finitely many segments of ones of length $k + 1$.
    By a segment of length $k$ we mean a consecutive sequence
    $X_i, X_{i+1}, \dots, X_{i+k-1}$.
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution}
    Let $p_n = 0$ if $n$ is a multiple of $k + 1$ and $1$ otherwise.
    That is, $(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k, p_{k+1}) = (1, 1, \dots, 1, 0)$
    and $(p_n)$ is periodic with period $k + 1$.
    Any $k+1$ consecutive indices $i, i+1, \dots, i+k$ must contain
    a multiple of $k+1$, so \[
        \P\set{X_i = X_{i+1} = \dots = X_{i+k} = 1} = 0.
    \] By the union bound, the probability that there is \emph{any} segment
    of ones of length $k+1$ is $0$.

    The event that there are infinitely many segments of ones of length
    $k$ is a subset of the event \[
        A \coloneq \set{X_n = 1 \text{ whenever } (k + 1) \nmid n}.
    \] This has probability $1$, since \[
        A = \bigcap_{(k + 1) \nmid n} \set{X_n = 1}
    \] is the intersection of almost sure events.\footnotemark
\end{solution}
\footnotetext{In case this cannot be assumed, $\P(A) = 1$ since
$A^c$ is a countable union of zero-probability events.}

% Problem 2
\begin{problem*}
    Let $A_1, A_2, \dots$ be a sequence of $M$ dependent events
    (i.e., $A_i$ and $A_j$ are independent iff $\abs{i - j} > M$).
    Prove that $\P(A_n \io) = 0$ or $1$.
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution}
    Let $N = M + 1$ for convenience.
    Consider the $N$ subsequences \begin{gather*}
        A_1, A_{1+N}, A_{1+2N}, \dots \\
        A_2, A_{2+N}, A_{2+2N}, \dots \\
        \vdots \\
        A_N, A_{N+N}, A_{N+2N}, \dots
    \end{gather*}
    Then $A_n \io$ iff infinitely many events from at least
    one of these subsequences occur.
    But $A_k, A_{k+N}, A_{k+2N}, \dots$ are independent for any $k$,
    so by Kolmogorov's zero-one law, $\P(A_{k+nN} \io) = 0$ or $1$
    (where $k$ is fixed and $n$ varies).
    \[
        \set{A_n \io} = \bigcup_{k=1}^N \set{A_{k+nN} \io}.
    \]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $\P(A_{k+nN} \io) = 0$ for all $k$, then $\P(A_n \io) = 0$
        by the union bound.
        \item If $\P(A_{k+nN} \io) = 1$ for some $k$,
        then $\P(A_n \io) \ge \P(A_{k+nN} \io) = 1$.
    \end{itemize}
    Thus $\P(A_n \io) = 0$ or $1$.
\end{solution}

% Problem 3
\begin{problem*}
% Let A1, A2, . . . be a sequence of events. Let nk be any sequence and Ck := Snk≤n<nk+1 An. Show that if Pn P(Cn) < ∞ then P(An i.o.) = 0.
    Let $A_1, A_2, \dots$ be a sequence of events.
    Let $(n_k)_k$ be any sequence and
    $C_k \coloneq \bigcup_{n_k \le n < n_{k+1}} A_n$.
    Show that if $\sum_n \P(C_n) < \infty$ then $\P(A_n \io) = 0$.
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution}
    It is assumed that $n_k$ are increasing.
    $\set{A_n \io} = \set{C_n \io}$, so by the first Borel-Cantelli lemma,
    $\P\set{A_n \io} = 0$.
\end{solution}

% Problem 4
\begin{problem*}
% Let A1, A2, . . . be a sequence of events in (Ω, F, P). Let pk be the probability that at least one of the events Ak, Ak+1, . . . occurs.
% (1) If inf pk > 0, then show that An occurs infinitely often, w.p.p (with positive probability). k
% (2) If pk → 0, then show that only finitely many An occur, w.p.1 (with probability 1).
    Let $A_1, A_2, \dots$ be a sequence of events in $(\Omega, \F, \P)$.
    Let $p_k$ be the probability that at least one of the events
    $A_k, A_{k+1}, \dots$ occcurs.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $\inf p_k > 0$, then show that $A_n$ occurs infinitely
        often, w.p.p (with positive probability).
        \item If $p_k \to 0$, then show that only finitely many $A_n$
        occur, w.p.1 (with probability $1$).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution} \leavevmode
    Let $B_k$ be the event that no $A_n$ occurs for $n \ge k$,
    and $B$ be the event that only finitely many $A_n$ occur.
    Then $B_1 \subseteq B_2 \subseteq \dots$ and $B = \bigcup_k B_k$.
    Thus $\P(B) = \lim_k \P(B_k) = \lim_k (1 - p_k)$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\P(B) < 1$.
        \item $\P(B) = 1$. \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem*}
% Let An be a sequence of independent events with P(An) < 1 for all n. Show that
% P(∪nAn) = 1 implies Pn P(An) = ∞.
    Let $A_n$ be a sequence of independent events with $\P(A_n) < 1$ for all
    $n$.
    Show that $\P\ab(\bigcup_n A_n) = 1$ implies $\sum_n \P(A_n) = \infty$.
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution}
    Let $B_n = \bigcup_{k \ge n} A_k$.
    We know that $A_1, \dots, A_{n-1}, B_n$ are independent.
    Thus \[
        \P(A_1^c \cap \dots \cap A_{n-1}^c \cap B_n^c)
            = \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (1 - p_k) (1 - \P(B_n))
    \] If this were positive, then $\P\ab(\bigcup_n A_n) < 1$.
    Thus $\P(B_n) = 1$.
    Then $\set{A_n \io} = \cap_n B_n$ almost surely, so $\P(A_n \io) = 1$.
    By the first Borel-Cantelli lemma, $\sum_n p_n = \infty$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem*}
% Let Xn and X are random variables and for all δ > 0,Pn P(|Xn − X| > δ) < ∞.
% Show that Xn → X almost surely.
    Let $X_n$ and $X$ be random variables such that for all $\delta > 0$,
    $\sum_n \P(\abs{X_n - X} > \delta) < \infty$.
    Show that $X_n \asto X$.
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution}
    Let $A_n = \set{\abs{X_n - X} > \frac1n \text{ finitely often}}$.
    By the first Borel-Cantelli lemma, $\P(A_n) = 1$.
    Then $\P\ab(\cap_n A_n) = 1$ gives that for each $\frac1n$, there exists
    $N$ such that $\abs{X_n - X} \le \frac1n$ for all $n \ge N$,
    almost surely.
    Thus $X_n \asto X$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem*}
% Let Xn be any sequence of random variables such that Xn < ∞ almost surely. Show
% that there are constants cn → ∞ such that Xn/cn → 0 almost surely.
    Let $X_n$ be any sequence of random variables such that $X_n < \infty$
    almost surely.
    Show that there are constants $c_n \to \infty$ such that
    $X_n/c_n \to 0$ almost surely.
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution}
    Let $c_n$ be such that $\P\set{nX_n \ge c_n} < \frac1{2^n}$.
    Then $\sum_n \P\set{X_n/c_n \ge \frac1n} < \infty$,
    so $X_n/c_n \asto 0$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem*}
% Let X1, X2, . . . be i.i.d. Exp(1) random variables and Mn = max1≤m≤n Xm. Show that
% (1) lim supn→∞ Xn/log n = 1 almost surely. (2) Mn/log n → 1 almost surely.
    Let $X_1, X_2, \dots$ be \iid $\Exp(1)$ random variables and
    $M_n = \max_{1 \le m \le n} X_m$.
    Show that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\limsup_{n \to \infty} X_n/\log n = 1$ almost surely.
        \item $M_n/\log n \to 1$ almost surely.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution} \leavevmode
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\P\set{X_i \ge t} = e^{-t}$.
        Thus $\P\set{X_n \ge k \log n} = \frac1{n^k}$
        is summable iff $k > 1$.
        Thus $X_n/\log n \ge 1$ infinitely often a.s.,
        so $\limsup X_n/\log n \ge 1$ almost surely.
        For any $\eps > 0$, $X_n/\log n \ge 1 + \eps$ only finitely often
        a.s., so $\limsup X_n/\log n \le 1$ almost surely.
        \item $M_n/\log n = \max_{1 \le m \le n} X_m/\log n$.
        If $X_m/\log m \ge 1 + \eps$ only finitely often, then
        $M_n/\log n < 1 + \eps$ for large enough $n$.
        (when $X_k/\log k$ is bounded by $1 + \eps$ and $\log n$ is large
        enough to make $X_m/\log n$ small even when $X_m/\log m$ is large).

        Now $M_n \le 1-\eps$ iff $X_k \le (1 - \eps) \log n$ for
        $k \in [n]$.
        \begin{align*}
            \P\set{M_n \le 1 - \eps}
                &= \prod_{k=1}^n \ab(1-e^{-(1-\eps)\log n}) \\
                &= \ab(1 - \frac1{n^{1-\eps}})^n \\
                &\le e^{-\frac1{n^{1-\eps}} n} \\
                &= e^{-n^\eps}.
        \end{align*}
        Let $\eps = \frac1m$.
        Then $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^2}{e^{n^\eps}}
        = \lim_{u \to \infty} \frac{u^{2m}}{e^2} = 0$.
        Thus $e^{-n^\eps}$ is summable.
        $M_n \le 1 - \eps$ finitely often a.s. for each $\eps$.
        Intersecting these events gives $M_n/\log n \to 1$ almost surely.
        \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem*}
% Let X1, X2, . . . be independent. Show that sup Xn < ∞ almost surely iff Pn P(Xn > A) < ∞ for some A.
    Let $X_1, X_2, \dots$ be independent.
    Show that $\sup X_n < \infty$ almost surely iff
    $\sum_n \P(X_n > A) < \infty$ for some $A$.
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution}
    If $X_n > A$ only finitely often, say only for some $n \le N$,
    then $\sup X_n \le \max\set{X_1, \dots, X_N} \vee A$.

    Conversely, suppose for all $A$, $X_n > A$ infinitely often.
    Then $\sup X_n = \infty$.

    Thus $\sup X_n < \infty$ iff there is some $A$ such that
    $X_n > A$ only finitely often.
    The two Borel-Cantelli lemmas give the result.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem*}
% Let ξ, ξn be i.i.d. random variables with E[log+ ξ] < ∞ and P(ξ = 0) < 1.
% (1) Show that the radius of convergence of the random power series P∞n=0 ξnzn is almost surely
% a constant.
% (2) Show that the radius of convergence is 1 almost surely by showing limsup|ξn|n = 1 a.s.
% n→∞
    Let $\xi, \xi_n$ be \iid random variables with $\E[\log_+ \xi] < \infty$
    and $\P(\xi = 0) < 1$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that the radius of convergence of the random power series
        $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \xi_n z^n$ is almost surely a constant.
        \item Show that the radius of convergence is $1$ almost surely by
        showing $\limsup_{n \to \infty} \abs{\xi_n}^{\frac1n} = 1$ almost
        surely.

\begin{problem*}
% Consider the Bernoulli bond percolation on Zd as defined in the class. Determine which of the following events are tail events: there exists a unique infinite cluster, 0 belongs to a infinite cluster, there are infinitely many infinite clusters, there are finitely many infinite clusters.
    Consider the Bernoulli bond percolation on $\Z^d$ as defined in class.
    Determine which of the following events are tail events:
        there exists a unique infinite cluster,
        $0$ belongs to a infinite cluster,
        there are infinitely many infinite clusters,
        there are finitely many infinite clusters.
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution} \leavevmode
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Whether there exists a unique infinite cluster is \emph{not}
        a tail event.
        Even in $\Z^1$, assume all edges except possibly $(-1, 0)$ and
        $(0, 1)$ are retained.
        Then there is either $1$ infinite cluster or $2$, depending on
        these $2$ edges.
        \item Whether $0$ belongs to an infinite cluster is \emph{not} a
        tail event.
        Same counterexample as before.
        \item Whether there are infinitely many infinite clusters \emph{is}
        a tail event.
        Finitely many edges can only affect finitely many clusters.
        \item Whether there are finitely many infinite clusters is the
        complement of the previous one, so also a tail event. \qedhere
    \end{itemize}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem*}
% Consider the Bernoulli bond percolation on Zd as defined in the class and consider the critical probability pc(Zd). Show that pc(Zd) > 0 for all d ≥ 1.
    Consider the Bernoulli bond percolation on $\Z^d$ as defined in class
    and consider the critical probability $p_c(\Z^d)$.
    Show that $p_c(\Z^d) > 0$ for all $d \ge 1$.
\end{problem*}
\begin{solution}
    We need to show that there is some $p > 0$ such that $G_p$ doesn't
    have an infinite cluster almost surely.

    % Fix a point $x \in \Z^d$ and let $B_n$ be the set of points at an
    % $L^\infty$ distance of $n$ from $x$.
    % Let $p_n$ be the probability that $x$ is connected to some point in
    % $B_n$.
    % Then \[
    %     p_n \le p_{n-1} \ab(1-(1-p)^{4k_n}), \quad p_0 = 1,
    % \] where $k_n = (2n+1)^{d-1}$.
    % Thus $p_n \le 4(2n+1)^{d-1} p p_{n-1}$,
    For $x \in \Z^d$, let $C_x$ be the event that $0$ is connected to $x$
    via a path contained entirely in the region
    $\sset{y \in \Z^d}{\norm y_1 \le \norm x_1}$.
    Let $p_n = \max_{\norm x_1 = n} \P(C_x)$.
    Then $p_n \le d p_{n-1} p$, so that $p_n \le d^n p^n$.
    If $A_n = \bigcup_{\norm x_1 = n} C_x$, then
    $\P(A_n) \le K n^d d^n p^n$ for some constant $K$.
    By the ratio test, this is summable for $p < \frac1d$.
    The Borel-Cantelli lemma gives $\P(A_n \io) = 0$.

    But for there to be an infinite cluster containing $0$,
    $0$ must be connected to some point in each $\set{\norm x_1 = n}$.
    For each of these sets, at least one point will be reachable from $0$
    without passing through any point with a larger Manhattan norm.
    Thus $\P(A_n \io) = 0$ gives that
    $\P(0 \text{ is in an infinite cluster}) = 0$.
    By the union bound, $\P(\text{there is an infinite cluster}) = 0$.
