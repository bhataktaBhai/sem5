# Semester 5 at IISc

I am crediting
- MA 200: Multivariable Calculus
- MA 212: Algebra I
- MA 361: Probability Theory
- E0 208: Computational Geometry
- E0 235: Cryptography

I will try to audit
- MA 231: Topology

I will occasionally attend (when interesting)
- MA 219: Linear Algebra
- E0 225: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

The other courses in the file tree are a relic of the past, when I was unsure of what to credit.

The code is a mess that is largely unrefactored from my first semester.
Venture into the source at your own risk.

## Compiling
I have no clue how relative paths work in LaTeX.
Change `~/IISc/sem5/` to `~/path/to/this/repo/` everywhere it is used.
I compile with latexmk using the VimTeX plugin for Neovim, but there should be no trouble with any method.
