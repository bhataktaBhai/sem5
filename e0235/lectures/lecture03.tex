\begin{theorem*}[Shannon's theorem] \label{thm:shannon}
    A scheme $(\Gen, \Enc, \Dec)$ with
    $\abs{\mcK} = \abs{\mcC} = \abs{\mcM}$ is perfectly secure
    if and only if
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Gen$ is a uniform distribution over $\mcK$.
        \item For every $m \in \mcM$ and $c \in \mcC$,
            there is a unique key $k \in \mcK$ such that
            $\Enc_k(m) = c$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem*}
Why do we care about $\abs \mcK = \abs \mcC = \abs \mcM$?
We will see $\abs \mcK \ge \abs \mcM$ is necessary for security.
% TODO: (\cref{}).
Equality is the optimal case.

Since $\Enc_k$ needs to be injective for each $k \in \mcK$,
$\abs \mcM \le \abs \mcC$.
Equality is the optimal case.

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $(\Gen, \Enc, \Dec)$ satisfies the conditions.
    We need to show $\Pr[C = c \mid M = m] = \Pr[C = c \mid M = m']$.
    Since there is a unique key for which $\Enc_k(m) = c$,
    $\Pr[C = c \mid M = m] = \Pr[K = k] = 1/\abs \mcK$.
    This is independent of $M$, so the two probabilities are equal.

    Now suppose $(\Gen, \Enc, \Dec)$ is perfectly secure.
    Fix a $c \in \mcC$.
    Let $\mcK_m = \sset{k \in \mcK}{\Enc_k(m) = c}$.

    \begin{claim}
        $\mcK_m \ne \O$ and $\mcK_m \cap \mcK_{m'} = \O$ for $m \ne m'$.
    \end{claim}
    Suppose there is some message $m_0$ for which
    $\Pr[C = c \mid M = m_0] > 0$.
    By perfect security, $\Pr[C = c \mid M = m] > 0$ for each $m \in \mcM$.
    If $\mcK_m = \O$ for some $m$, then $\Pr[C = c \mid M = m] = 0$.

    Since $\Enc_k$ is injective for each $k \in \mcK$,
    the same key cannot encrypt two different messages to the same
    ciphertext.
    Thus $\mcK_m \cap \mcK_{m'} = \O$ for $m \ne m'$.

    Since \[
        \Pr[K = k_m] = \Pr[C = c \mid M = m] = \Pr[C = c \mid M = m']
        = \Pr[K = k_{m'}],
    \] we have $\Pr[K = k_m] = 1/\abs \mcK$.
\end{proof}

We now have three equivalent definitions of perfect security:
\cref{def:ske:perfect,thm:ske:perfect,thm:shannon}.
