\begin{lemma}
    If $f\colon X \to Y$ is continuous and $X$ is connected, then
    $f(X)$ is connected.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose WLOG that $f$ is surjective, \ie, $f(X) = Y$.

    Assume there exist two non-empty disjoint open sets $U, V$ such that
    $U \cup V = Y$.
    Then $X = f^{-1}(U \cup V) = f^{-1}(U) \cup f^{-1}(V)$ gives
    a separation of $X$.
    The two sets are open by continuity, disjoint by disjointedness in $Y$,
    and non-empty by surjectivity.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    $\R$ is connected.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof 1]
    Adapt the proof of $[0, 1]$ being connected.

    Let $U, V$ separate $\R$.
    Let $a = \sup U$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof 2]
    We already know that $[0, 1]$ is connected.
    For each $n \in \Z^+$, the linear map $0 \mapsto -n$, $1 \mapsto n$
    is continuous (in fact, a homeomorphism).
    Thus $[-n, n]$ is connected.

    The union of all these intervals is $\R$, and they intersect in
    $\set 0$.
    Thus $\R$ is connected.
